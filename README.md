# ZscoreCipher
A cipher that converts character to their ASCII values and then standardizes the result.



# How to Use
Run the python script. "In words to use" enter the sentince you wish to encrypt. the encrypted zscores will be right above the keys. Both keys are required to decrypt. After you have entered the keys to decrypt, copy the zscores contained above the keys, it will look something like this: -1.0 0.0 1.0
the zscores can also be more drastic, like this: 1.73893482893847
paste the full zscore list into the "all chrs to decrypt" area.
a minimum of 3 characters is required to encrypt.



# How it Works
In statistics, there is an operation known as standardization. This program takes the ASCII values of all the results and standardizes them, giving you an encyrypted value that requires 2 keys to decrypt. 

>In statistics, standardization is the process of putting different variables on the same scale. This process allows you to compare scores between different types of variables. Typically, to standardize variables, you calculate the mean and standard deviation for a variable. Then, for each observed value of the variable, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.

Excerpt from [here](https://statisticsbyjim.com/glossary/standardization/). As you may have guessed, the dycryption keys are the mean and standard deviation.
